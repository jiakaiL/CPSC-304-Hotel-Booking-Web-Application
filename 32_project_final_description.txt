Our project is building a database system for a hotel company that owns several
properties.
We have two types of users for the system:
  + Staff
  + Customer

+ Customers
  - Room Search
    * customers are able to search available hotel rooms by providing location
      and date information
    * They can then pick a room from the list to reserve a room

+ Hotel Staff
  - Customer Management
      * Search Customer
        / Find customer's information including customer ID, name, membership
          points and booking information using the phone number
      * Customer Check-in
        / Staff can query for VIP customers and give them promotions when
          when they check-in
        / The criteria to be a VIP customer is to have stayed in all hotels
          owned by the company
      * Customer Information
        / Staff is able to delete a customer's record from the system.

  - Hotel Service
      * Shuttle Service Schedule
        / Print the shuttle bus service request for a particular day and hotel

  - Financial Statement
      * Dinner Income
        / Find the best and worst hotels in terms of dinner income in all times

We have made very minor changes to the schema, only add one or two new attribute
to the entities for easier understanding.
We have changed the design of functionalities of the two use types to align with
what has been requested from the demo checklist.
